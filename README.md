Beautiful Soup is a *Python library* for pulling data out of *HTML* and *XML* files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests

```
After finishing the installation process above, you can run the task, using `python3 gaana_scraper.py`.
